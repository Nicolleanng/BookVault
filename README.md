# BookVault

The personal book tracker/storage program, BookVault, that I am creating is necessary because it allows book readers to store all their book titles in one organized location. As someone that reads a lot, it can be difficult keeping track of the books weâ€™re currently reading, ones we own, those we want, or the ones we have already read. Having one place for all this information allows you to keep things organized.
